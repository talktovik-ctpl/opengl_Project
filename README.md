The First Program is Paint Program.
Made by C++ Using opengl.
Here one can draw points(pixels),Quadilateral(by clicking twice in the drawing window) and same a circle with 2 point.
Fill is also implemented, means it will somewhere mimic the concept of paintbrush in windows.
Since We it is purely based on C++ so I used areawise pickup so that I could get various tools. 
Please do have a look
